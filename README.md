Mask bot is a neural network based streamlit application that detects  if you're a male or female, if you're wearing a mask or not. As a bonus, it detects if you're smiling if your mask is off!

Use the package manager pip to install requirements.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Navigate using the cmd to the folder where the files are and use:
```
streamlit run main.py
```
